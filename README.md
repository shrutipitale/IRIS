# Iris Dataset Clustering

## Overview
From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

## Columns

1. **age**: Age of the individual in years.
2. **sex**: Biological sex of the individual (male or female).
3. **bmi**: Body Mass Index (BMI) of the individual, a measure of body fat based on height and weight.
4. **children**: Number of children or dependents covered by the insurance plan.
5. **smoker**: Binary indicator if the individual smokes (yes or no).
6. **region**: The residential area of the individual in the United States (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest).
7. **charges**: Medical insurance costs billed by the insurance company.


## Steps to Perform Clustering Analysis

1. **Load the Dataset:**
   - Load the Iris dataset from scikit-learn or from a local CSV file if available.

2. **Preprocess the Data:**
   - Perform preprocessing steps such as feature scaling if necessary.

3. **Determine Optimal Number of Clusters:**
   - Use techniques like the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score to find the optimal number of clusters.

4. **Cluster the Data:**
   - Apply a clustering algorithm such as K-means using the determined number of clusters.

5. **Visualize the Clusters:**
   - Plot the clustered data to visualize how the data points are grouped.
