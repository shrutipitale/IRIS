# Iris Dataset Clustering

## Overview
From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

## Columns

1. **Id**: Unique identifier for each entry.
2. **SepalLengthCm**: Length of the sepal in centimeters.
3. **SepalWidthCm**: Width of the sepal in centimeters.
4. **PetalLengthCm**: Length of the petal in centimeters.
5. **PetalWidthCm**: Width of the petal in centimeters.
6. **Species**: Species of the iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica).

## Usage

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualize distributions and correlations between variables.
- **Clustering**: Identify natural groupings of flowers based on their measurements.

## Steps to Perform Clustering Analysis
1. **Importing Libraries and Loading Dataset**
   - Start by importing necessary Python libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, sklearn) and load the Iris dataset.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Visualize distributions and correlations between variables such as Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width. This helps understand the dataset's structure before clustering.

3. **Find The Number of Clusters**
   - Use techniques like the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters for K-means clustering.

4. **Train The Model**
   - Implement a clustering algorithm (e.g., K-means) using the determined number of clusters to train the model on the dataset.

5. **Cluster Visualization**
   - Visualize the clustered data to observe how the flowers are grouped based on their measurements. This helps interpret the results and understand the distinct clusters.
